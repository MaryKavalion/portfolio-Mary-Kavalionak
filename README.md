# About Me

👋 Hi there! I'm Mary, a dedicated AI&ML student dreaming to learn and create exciting projects in the world of technology.

🌟 Learning is my superpower, and I'm constantly exploring something new. I've been a language teacher before, and now I'm transitioning from teaching people to teaching machines.🤖

📚 Currently, I'm diving deep into Python. I'm excited about the endless possibilities it offers!

🤝 I'm eager to connect with fellow students and developers who share my passion for tech. Let's learn, grow, and code together!
